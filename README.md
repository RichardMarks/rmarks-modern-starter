## Thanks
I'd like to thank everyone I have worked with at Curriculum Associates and Syrinx Consulting for what I have learned this December.
I would also like to thank my family for putting up with my long work hours.
And finally, I want to thank God, because without Him, I wouldn't be able to do the things I do.
