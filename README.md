# Task List App using ES6, React, and Alt
> Last Updated December 30th 2015

* ECMAScript 6 via Babel 6.x for modular modern code support
* WebPack & Dev Server for distribution packaging
* Gulp for building
* Mocha & Chai for testing
* ESDoc for documentation generation
* ReactJS for the View implementation
* Alt.js for the Flux pattern
* Bootstrap for styling

## Another Task List App!? Why?
I created this project as a means to learn how to use React and Alt.
> Disclaimer: By no means is this software intended for public use.

## Features
* task list is initially populated using mock-data for demonstration purposes
* add new tasks to the ask list
* mark tasks as done
* remove tasks from the task list
* task list is stored in localStorage after each operation

## Future
I might visit this project at a later date to implement the following in no particular order:

* task descriptions
* task categories
* sub-tasks
* tags
* task archival
* save to remote server
* export tasks to file
* write unit tests
